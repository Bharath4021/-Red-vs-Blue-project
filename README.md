# -Red-vs-Blue-project
For our Master’s Research Project, we built an isolated Red vs Blue cybersecurity lab using Proxmox and implemented the Wazuh SIEM. We performed Red Team attacks such as scanning and exploitation, and conducted Blue Team analysis using Wazuh, Sysmon, and firewall logs to detect and respond to threats.
